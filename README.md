 Task1:
 --------

1) Sum of Two Numbers-Expalanation
   
This program takes two numbers from the user and adds them.
The values are stored in variables, then the addition operator (+) is used to calculate the sum.
Finally, the result is displayed on the screen.

2) Odd or Even Checker – Explanation
The program checks whether a number is odd or even.
If a number is divisible by 2 (remainder is zero), it is an even number.
If the remainder is not zero, the number is odd.
This is done using the modulo operator (%).

3) Factorial Calculation – Explanation
Factorial of a number is the product of all positive integers from 1 to that number.
The program initializes a variable fact as 1 and multiplies it with each number from 1 to n using a loop.
After the loop ends, the factorial value is printed.

4) Fibonacci Series – Explanation
The Fibonacci series is a sequence where each number is the sum of the previous two numbers.
The program starts with 0 and 1.
Using a loop, the next number is calculated by adding the last two numbers, and the sequence is printed up to the required number of terms.

5) String Reverse – Explanation
This program reverses the given string.
Python slicing ([::-1]) is used to reverse the string easily.
The reversed string is then stored in a variable and displayed.

6) Palindrome Check – Explanation
A palindrome is a word or number that reads the same forward and backward.
The program reverses the given input and compares it with the original value.
If both are the same, it is a palindrome; otherwise, it is not.

7) Leap Year Check – Explanation
A leap year has 366 days.
The program checks the leap year conditions:
The year should be divisible by 400, or
The year should be divisible by 4 but not by 100
If any condition is true, it is a leap year.

8) Armstrong Number – Explanation
An Armstrong number is a number where the sum of the cubes of its digits is equal to the original number.
The program extracts each digit using modulo and division, calculates the cube, and adds it to a sum.
If the final sum is equal to the original number, it is an Armstrong number.
